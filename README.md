## Model Providers

Flow Chat uses [Claude AI](https://www.anthropic.com/) as its default LLM, and our own [FLOW-MCP](https://github.com/Outblock/flow-mcp) for processing Flow onchain requests.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Flow Chat. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: Do not commit your `.env` file to version control, as it may expose secrets for your AI and authentication providers.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
